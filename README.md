**Name:** GOWRI
**Company:** CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS
**ID:** CT08PP466
**DOMAIN:** DATA ANALYTICS
**DURATION:** MAY TO JUNE 2024
**MENTOR:** SRIVANI GOUNI

** Overview of the project

*** Project: Create a test model and train it for linear regression

*** Objective: Implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

*** Key Activities
1.Understanding the Problem
2.Data Collection
3.Data Preprocessing
4.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5.Splitting the Data
6.Training the Model
7.Evaluating the Model
8.Making Predictions
9.Visualizing the Results
10.Improving the Model

*** Technologies Used
**python**: For data analysis due to its simplicity, readability, and the rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.
**Pandas**: Functions for reading/writing data from various formats (CSV, Excel, SQL databases). And Essential for data manipulation and analysis.
**Numpy**: Provides support for arrays, matrices, and a large collection of mathematical functions.
**Matplotlib**: Helps create static, interactive, and animated plots.
**Seaborn**:  higher-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
**Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library. Provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

*** Conclusion for the Linear Regression Model 

65% rate of prediction attain in random data values
